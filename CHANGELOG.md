  - `mlflow.log_artifact()` — saves best model checkpoint to MLflow
  - Prints MLflow Run ID on training completion

- `requirements.txt` — Added `mlflow>=2.0`

### Changed
- `colab_train.ipynb` — Updated Step 3 to show per-package install status
- `colab_train.ipynb` — Added `--mlflow-dir` parameter to training command
- `colab_train.ipynb` — Renamed Step 8 (Clear Checkpoints) for clarity

  - Top-1 / Top-5 Accuracy
  - Per-class Accuracy across all 100 CIFAR-100 categories
  - Confusion Matrix heatmap (Top-20 most confused classes)
  - Classification Report (Precision / Recall / F1-score)
  - Loss / Accuracy curve plots from `training_log.json`
  - Summary JSON with overall metrics and best/worst 5 classes
  - Saves `labels.npy` and `preds.npy` for downstream analysis

- `demo.py` — Gradio interactive demo
  - Upload any image for Top-5 classification
  - Random sample button with ground truth display

- `colab_train.ipynb` — Added Step 7 (Evaluation) and Step 8 (Clear Checkpoints)
